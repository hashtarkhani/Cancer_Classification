This repository provides the Python code used in the study titled:
"Comparative Performance of Large Language Models with BioBERT for Cancer Diagnosis Categorization in Electronic Health Records."

The code includes two main components:
1. Categorization of structured and unstructured cancer diagnosis data into predefined categories using ChatGPT models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4).
2. Evaluation of model performance and identification of common misclassifications based on comparison with expert-labeled data.
